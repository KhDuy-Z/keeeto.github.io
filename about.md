	<h1 class="pageTitle">About Me</h1>

	<p class="intro">My name is Keith Butler. I work as a staff scientist in the ISIS facility at Rutherford Appleton Laboratories. My interest is in helping to interpret the data collected in the complex experiments being done at ISIS using neutrons and muons. Neutrons and muons can be used to explore structure, dynamics, defects and many other properties of materials with increasingly high resolution. These experiments are at the cutting edge of research across the materials community, from alloys in aerospace, to protein structure, to next generation catalysts, photovoltaics and superconductors. My role at ISIS, as part of the <a href="https://www.mantidproject.org/Main_Page">Mantid Project</a> is to help software developers and instrument users to connect more efficiently and facilitate leading research.</p>

	<h2>Background</h2>
	I have a background in using computational techniques to understand and design new materials. Most of my work in the past few years has centred on photovoltaics (materials for generating electricity from sunlight) and hybrid materials (materials with organic and inorganic components), and the intersection of the two fields. 
	<br>
	I was lucky enough to be working in <a href="http://wmd-group.github.io/">Aron Walsh's group</a> at the start of the new field of hybrid perovskite solar cells. These materials have revolutionised research in solar energy, offering the possibility of low-cost, highly efficient solar panels, that could change the renewable energy landscape <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ccar3uqWsw">here's a TED talk on the topic</a>. It was a really exciting time and we learnt a lot about things like ferroelectric photovoltaics, see Figure 1 and our paper  <a href="http://pubs.rsc.org/-/content/articlehtml/2015/ee/c4ee03523b">'Ferroelectric materials for solar energy conversion: photoferroics revisited')</a>, and the importance of vibrational entropy for phase changes in hybrids (<a href="http://pubs.rsc.org/-/content/articlehtml/2016/sc/c6sc02199a">Organised chaos: entropy in hybrid inorganicâ€“organic systems and other materials</a>). This has led me to my latest challenge, which is to help use software to understand the fundamental structure and dynamics of materials by helping to interpret neutron experiments at the <a href='https://www.isis.stfc.ac.uk/Pages/home.aspx'>UK's ISIS facility</a>.
	<br>
	In <a href="https://keeeto.github.io/">my blog </a> I'll try to regularly find some time to write about the subjects that I am researching, or that are simply interesting me and that I feel I have some kind of worthwhile opinion about.
	

  <h2>Software</h2>
  
 During the past few years I have been busy developing and applying tools to accelerate materials discovery. I make these tools available under open source licenses on <a href='https://github.com/keeeto/'>my GitHub page.</a>

	
	<h3>SMACT</h3>
	
	<img align="left" hspace="20" src="{{ '/assets/images/smact-toc.jpeg' | prepend: site.baseurl }}" alt="" width="200"> 
	
<a href="http://smact.readthedocs.io/en/latest/introduction.html"> SMACT </a>stands for Semiconducting Materials from Analogy and Chemical Theory. It is a set of tools to use simple chemical descriptors, statistical models and high-throughput workflows to discover new materials. SMACT is written in simple modular Python and allows users to develop their own models and workflows using the basic machinery provided. In recent years we have had our first publications exploring the vast hyperspace of hitherto un-reported materials. I wrote a bit more about these in another post.
	
	<h3>Macordensity</h3>
	
	
	<img align="right" hspace="20" src="{{ 'https://github.com/keeeto/BandAlignmentBootcamp/raw/master/hybrid_bands.jpeg' | prepend: site.baseurl }}" alt="" width="200"> 
	
	<a href="https://github.com/WMD-group/MacroDensity">MacroDensity</a> s a set of tools for analysing and manipulating electron densities obtained from quantum mechanical calculations of materials. This is useful for finding electron binding energies, aligning bands, calculating defect levels and many other properties. I explain how to use MacroDensity in a <a href="https://github.com/WMD-group/MacroDensity/tree/master/tutorials"> series of tutorials</a>, available as iPython notebooks.

<h2>Food</h2>
<img align="right" hspace="20" src="{{ 'http://fodblog.github.io/assets/pictures/caprese_omlette.jpg' | prepend: site.baseurl }}" alt="" width="300">

In my spare time I do a lot of exploring food, eating and making. For several years before my science jobs I worked in kitchens, ranging from stacking the back of hot food <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FEBO">"Febo" style</a> vending machines, to the five star <a href="http://cafeamericain.nl/">Hotel Americain</a>. 

<img align="left" hspace="20" src="{{ 'http://fodblog.github.io/assets/pictures/baked-egg-kale.jpg' | prepend: site.baseurl }}" alt="" width="300">

I'm currently pretty obsessed with pickling and fermenting. I am working on my pickled eggs and kimchi. I write a regular food blog, which is also focussed on Fodmap-frinedly recipes. Fodmap means that the recipes are suitable for people with IBS, you can find more <a href="https://fodblog.github.io/">on the FodBlog</a>.
