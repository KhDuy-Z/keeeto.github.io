	<h1 class="pageTitle">About Me</h1>

	<p class="intro">I work as a data scientist leading the materials research in the SciML team based at Rutherford Appleton Laboratory. SciML is a team in the Scientific Computing Division and we work with the large STFC facilities (Diamond, ISIS Neutron and Muon Source and Central Laser Facility for example) to use machine learning to push the boundaries of fundamantal science.</p>

  <h2>Background</h2>
  
  I have a background in computational materials sceince. I have worked for more than 10 years using atomistic models to design new materials and to help with analysis of experimental data. I have experience using high performance computing for simulations using density functional theory and classical models. I also develop machine learning models using Scikit-learn, Keras and TensorFlow.

  <h2>Software</h2>
  
 During the past few years I have been busy developing and applying tools for materials science. I make these tools available under open source licenses on <a href='https://github.com/keeeto/'>my GitHub page.</a>

	
	<h3>SMACT</h3>

<a href="http://smact.readthedocs.io/en/latest/introduction.html"> SMACT </a>stands for Semiconducting Materials from Analogy and Chemical Theory. It is a set of tools to use simple chemical descriptors, statistical models and high-throughput workflows to discover new materials. SMACT is written in simple modular Python and allows users to develop their own models and workflows using the basic machinery provided. In recent years we have had our first publications exploring the vast hyperspace of hitherto un-reported materials. I wrote a bit more about these in another post.
	
	<h3>Macrodensity</h3>

	<a href="https://github.com/WMD-group/MacroDensity">MacroDensity</a> s a set of tools for analysing and manipulating electron densities obtained from quantum mechanical calculations of materials. This is useful for finding electron binding energies, aligning bands, calculating defect levels and many other properties. I explain how to use MacroDensity in a <a href="https://github.com/WMD-group/MacroDensity/tree/master/tutorials"> series of tutorials</a>, available as iPython notebooks.

<h2>Food</h2>

In my spare time I do a lot of exploring food, eating and making. For several years before my science jobs I worked in kitchens, ranging from stacking the back of hot food <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FEBO">"Febo" style</a> vending machines, to the five star <a href="http://cafeamericain.nl/">Hotel Americain</a>.

I'm currently pretty obsessed with pickling and fermenting. I am working on my pickled eggs and kimchi. I write a regular food blog, which is also focussed on Fodmap-frinedly recipes. Fodmap means that the recipes are suitable for people with IBS, you can find more <a href="https://fodblog.github.io/">on the FodBlog</a>.
