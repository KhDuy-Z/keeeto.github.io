<blockquote> Kedar Hippalgaonkar is a researcher at the A*Star laboratory in Singapore, where he is helping to lead the way in builing an autonomous materials discovery laboratory. Kedar moved to Singapore after working as a postdoc in Berkeley. I met up with him at the ICMAT conference where he shared his materials and sporting passions for materials hipster.

### What's your favourite all time material?

I would have to say it's silicon. I'll go for the safe answer, but there's a few things that make it my favourite. It's a great materials because you can engineer it to be whatever you want. It's a great base material, my background is in thermal conductivity, in silicon the bonds are very harmonic, which means you get very high speed of sound, group velocity, but the phonon mean free path can actually be engineered by making it into a nano-structure and so you can reduce the thermal conductivity down from around 150 to about 5 just by engineering the microstructure and the phonons. It's a really beautiful system and then you can play around with surface to volume ratio to tune conductivity and there's a lot of work that's gone into it. And it also has very high electronic mobility, which is why it's great for transistors.

From the business point of view too, silicon is fantastic. People have spent a lot of time figuring out how to efficiently produce silicon. So if you can figure out a clever way yo engineer it for your application, then the capital investment is very low. That's the reason why I think silicon is still the champion.

### What material is super-hot right now?

Oh, I'd say the hydrides, like the high-pressure hydrides. They're hot because at high temperature they are still superconductors. Recently people showed showed that you can get superconductivity up to 280K [[see here](https://physics.aps.org/articles/v12/1)], whereas before the hydride the highest temperature superconductors were up to 39K - that's pretty cool! [There is a great article on this in [Physics World](https://physicsworld.com/a/could-high-pressure-hydrides-be-high-temperature-superconductors/)] The thing is, the structures that have this kind of superconductivity all exist only at very high pressure, so it's hard to use them in practice. But if you can think of some sort of non-equilibrium way to stabilise that high-pressure phase, but without the pressure, then you change the game.

### Any tips for the next big thing in materials' science?

The answer for me is obvious. The mixture of AI, high-throughput experiments, high-performance computing and then linking all of them together for what we call an automated workflow. So it's not just that a high-performance computing person is doing their calculations or someone is just doing automated experiments in isolation. It has to be all the way through from discovering the material, making it, testing it, the characterisation has to be fast so that you actually go right through one cycle of learning very fast. Then you're going to use machine learning to automate that whole process, that's what's key I think.

### If you could only read one journal which one would it be?

Hmmm I think the physical reviews series, one of them. I guess Physical Review Letters. My favourite papers that I have read from the history of physics have been PRLs. Because of the quality of how they articulate the arguments in a very comprehensive way.

### Tell me about a criminally under-rated journal

I can give a broad answer to that. In today's publishing climate I really miss some of those great journals that are domain specific, where all the reviewers are experts. That doesn't really happen any more, because everyone is chasing impact factors. One that comes to mind from my background is the Journal of Heat Transfer, ironically I have never published there, but although the impact factor is not very high, in that community it is very well respected. Of course there is an advantage to journals having broad scopes, because you can get people stoking new ideas, but I think there is definitely an important place for the domain journal.

### PRL or JACS? 

Already answered, I am not a chemist, I love the physics stuff!!

### What's the best crafted paper you've read recently?

There is a paper that always comes back to me, which is the best crafted that I have ever read. It is by Paul McEwan on carbon nanotubes (CNTs), he measured the quantum Hall effect, it was a PRL paper...obviously! It was beautifully written, the experiments were so nicely done, signal-to-noise characterised properly etc. And they didn't even fully theoretically understand the effect that they were measuring, but all the arguments that they put forward were so well laid that it is like reading a story. You start off reading and you get totally immersed and lost in the paper and by the time that you finish everything just makes sense. That's something I would love to emulate in every paper that I write!

### Who's papers make you read a bit deeper?

Alex Zunger - he's clearly thought about things quite deeply and he's done this stuff for a very long time and the way he phases things is great. 
David Mitzi's paper's too, he's a wizard! Some of the stuff, you don't see the connections at all before you read the papers, those are inspiring.

### If you were choosing your first postdoc position right now, where would you do it and why?

I am biased, I love Berkeley, so I am going to go back to Berkeley. I'll tell you why, it's got this perfect mix. It's laid-back, but it's serious at the same time and that's because the people that work there are really self-motivated. In some way they are doing the work for the purity of things, not because it's fashionable, even if they network they network for the right reasons, because they want to learn things.

I think that there was also probably a similar great atmosphere in Bell Lab's back in the day, so if I could time travel too, I love to go and work there. Also the Princeton Institute for Advanced Study is a very special place - it has the smartest people in mathematics and they get to choose whatever they work on usually the people are well established in their careers, but at the IAS there is just no pressure and they can work on what they like. [Aside, there is indeed an impressive list of members - Einstein, von Neumann, Gödel ...]

### Favourite conference?

It has to be MRS, the Boston one, because there's real pedigree there. I've gone there five years in a row. I used to go the spring one, but the way people come together for the fall MRS is great. You get people from all over the world. The weather's kind of chilly, but not snowy yet and you just hear some really great talks.

### Best conference catering you've experienced?

The conference we're at right now, ICMAT. They have some really fantastic food, considering that there are 2800 people coming, they still get some of the best catering in Singapore. They have a broad mix of western and Asian food, it's delicious!

### Worst conference catering?

MRS! It really doesn't do any catering! And you just get Starbucks coffee, which sucks. I think that they bring in enough money to not do Starbucks, maybe support some local coffee shops and at least get some pastries - I would appreciate that.

### What do you do outside materials?

I love sports. I don't actually like the water, but I love diving - my wife likes diving and so I followed her and now I'm getting reasonably comfortable being underwater. You get to see nature as is and it kind of reminds you why you are doing what you are doing. There is fantastic diving around Singapore, if there's one reason why I tell people they should come to Singapore it's the tropical climate, the diving, the beaches.

### Whiskey or gin?  

Depends on where I am at. If I'm in Scotland or Ireland definitely whisk(e)y, certainly single malt, I don't mind the peaty stuff either. But gin in Singapore, it's too hot to have whiskey, Tom Collins, that's your go to cocktail in Singapore!!
