title:  "Hydrogen bonding in hybrids"
date:   2014-12-15
description: We recently developed a new method to estimate hydrogen bonding strength in hybrid organic-inorganic material. In this post I have a quick look at the problem and how we approached it.

<blockquote>I explore how our new work sheds light on how hydrogen bonding controls the properties of hybrid organic-inorganic perovskite materials.</blockquote>

A lot of the work that I have been doing in recent years concerns hybrid materials, which combine building blocks from the traditionally separate fields of organic and inorganic chemistry. This is a very interesting area to work in as it involves a confluence of ideas, methods and languages, making it fertile territory for new advances. I think that our recent work on hydrogen bonding strength in hybrid perovskite materials is a good example of this.

Perovskites are a good place to start as they are almost the archetype of classic design principles in inorganic solid state chemistry. The rules of Goldschmidt are amongst the most celebrated composition structure relationsips, that is a way to relate the elements in a chemical formaula to the 3D arrangment of the atoms in a solid. Goldschmidt built a beautifully simple geometric representation of the perovskite lattice and essentially represented the problem as one of packing spheres of different sizes (various elements). See the Figure below.
