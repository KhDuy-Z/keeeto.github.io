It's been a busy summer, not least the fantastic fortnight spent at [NPU](http://en.nwpu.edu.cn/)in Xi'an cementing the collaboration with the Materials Science and Engineering group of [Artem Oganov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artem_R._Oganov) there. I delivered a lecture at the excellent summer school and discussed how to strengthen our work over the next year. To top it all off we submitted out first joined publication just last week - fingers crossed for it to appear up here soon!
