# Git history re-write



<blockquote>Re-writing history is one of the things that terrifies me about `git`. The idea that with a few rogue keystrokes I can play Joe Stalin on the history of a project seems like a bit too much power. Luckily it is not that easy to do by mistake, but what if you did want to do it, for some reason?</blockquote>

I was recently working on a few new branches and obviously, being careless committed changes meant for one branch to the other. I didn't realise this until it came time for me to issue a pull request, for someone to merge my branch into the master. Naturally the rogue commit was both confusing and embarrassing; so I wanted it gone. 

Thanks to Dan Nixon for showing me this fix.

* Establish which commit it is I want to remove - `git log`

* Here I want to remove: `The first files for the error reporting GUI, not yet functional`
* Be sure that this is committed to another branch - otherwise we will lose it!

* Copy the hash of the commit immediately below this commit, in this case: `de7faa7c3d5a99f11705349206f5f7e3affb1ce4`

* Run an interactive rebase `git rebase -i de7faa7c3d5a99f11705349206f5f7e3affb1ce4` This lands us in an editor like this:

-

	pick fcd442c880 switched to new instrument definition file
	pick 9be43d8b6a Re #21735 Added the parameters files to match new MAPS IDF.
	pick fb5ecc711c Re #21735 Modified valid from field to avoid conflicts
-
* Choose the commit to drop and change pick to drop
* `wq`
* Finally: `git push --force-with-lease`
* DONE
